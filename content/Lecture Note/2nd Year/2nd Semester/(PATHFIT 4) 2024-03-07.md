***
Volleyball was invented on **1895** by **William G. Morgan**. Noong mga tim na 'to, bago pa lang din yung larong basketball, and William found basketball as too vigorous (masyadong physical-an) that's why ayaw rin s'yang laruin ng mga businessmen at students. He invented volleyball because of this reason. Additionally, it was called **Mintonette**, which means being separated by net, during that time.
