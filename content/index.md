> [!note] NOTE
> This is a work in progress.

Hi! Welcome to my publicly available [[digital garden|digital garden]]. It's basically a collection of univ-related notes I created while taking my online classes. Bear in mind that it will not be perfect. There will be typos and grammatical errors, and some may contain incomplete information due to my lazy ass xD. So, don't judge me! (makikitingin ka na nga lang eh)

To get started, you can go to [[+MOC 2Y2S|+MOC 2Y2S]] to see all the currently available lecture notes. I will be prioritizing subjects that I'm currently taking, but I'll also upload notes from my previous year if I have the time.

That's all for me!

p.s. ito nga pala number ko... kimmy!
